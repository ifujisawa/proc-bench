Given two sequences, where one is composed of numbers and the other is of characters, form pairs of a number and a character extracted from the sequences, respectively, in the form of a string.
Then, follow the procedure below.
Initialize an empty string and start from the first element of each sequence.
At each step, append the number and then the character obtained from the sequences to the string, and move to the next elements in both sequences.
If the end of either sequence is reached, wrap around to the beginning.
Repeat the process for N steps.

Provide the final string along with all the intermediate strings in a list.
Do not include the initial state and final state in the list of intermediate states.
