Decode a given set of compressed representations in the form of AxB, where B is the number of consecutive occurrences of the character A.
Starting from the first piece and an empty string, decode each piece by repeating the character A for the specified number of times B, and append the decoded result to the string. Repeat the decoding for the all pieces.
Provide the final string along with the intermediate strings after decoding each piece in a list.
Do not include the final state in the list of intermediate states.
