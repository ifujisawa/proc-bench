Make calculations in a specific manner as follows:

For each string, count the number of alphabets and encode it as N1, then concatenate all numeric characters in the order of apperance to form a single number N2. If no numeric character is included, let the number be zero.
Then, calculate the product of N1 and N2, which is N3.
Repeat the calculation for all substrings, starting from the first string.

Provide the sum of all N3 values along with the intermediate results in a 2D array, where each row includes the list [string, N1, N2, N3] for each substring.
Do not include the final state in the list of intermediate states.
