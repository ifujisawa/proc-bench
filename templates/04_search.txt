Count the occurrences of substrings in each given string step by step:
Start with an initial counting list with zeros, where each element correponds to the count for each string.
For each substring, count the occurrences of the substring in each string, and add the occurrences to counts in the counting list.
Repeat the step for all substrings starting from the first substring in the given list. 
                                                                      
Provide the final counting list along with the intermediate states in a 2D array, where each row includes the counting list after each step.
Do not include the initial state and final state in the list of intermediate states.
